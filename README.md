# HarvardX

Collection of miscellaneous odds and ends from the HarvardX PH125.9X capstone project, which is the last requirement of the Data Science Professional Certificate that I've been pursuing. Code is free to use and modify as you see fit - just cite this repo as appropriate and necessary, don't plagiarize me, and always be sure to toss a coin to your Witcher ;)
